    <h1><span style="color: coral">Kirsten's Picks for the Top 5 Budget Friendly Austin Restaurants</span></h1>
    <p>As an Austinite for over four years I eaten at quite a few restaurants. Some good, some not so good, some over priced, and some hidden gems. Covid has definitely left me pinching my pennies, but it hasn't stopped my appetite! Here are my top five budget friendly picks for Austin. (The restaurants below are following CDC guidelines and have take out available if you are uncomfortable dining in.) </p>

    <h2>Top 5 Budget Friendly Austin Restaurants</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>
                <a href="http://www.chuys.com/"> Chuy's Tex-Mex</a>  
                <b class="term">$</b>
            </h4>
        </li>
        <img src="https://hoodline.imgix.net/uploads/story/image/654799/o__1_.jpg?auto=format" width=300>
            <p>I know it is a national chain now, but it started right here on Barton Springs Rd. They are serving a limited menu and offer a variety of Tex-Mex classics including queso, tacos, fajitas and my all time favorite enchiladas! Their <b class="term">Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom enchilada</b> is my go to. It's cheesy and spicy and makes life worth living! </p>
        <li>
            <h4>
                <a href="https://buddysburger.com/">Buddy's Burger</a>  
                <b class="term">$</b>
            </h4>
        </li>
        <img src="https://cdn.usarestaurants.info/assets/uploads/3d84d9aa683b4b3be17a390b59709b13_-united-states-texas-travis-county-austin-buddys-burger-512-401-3325htm.jpg" width=300>
        <p>A newcomer breaking into the ever competitive Austin Burger Scene, Buddy's packs a punch. With a potato bun and their signiture Smack Sauce its a new burger experience. Paired with their <b class="term">mexican vanilla oreo shake</b> or a <b class="term">$4 pint</b> and some <b class="term">seasoned fries</b>, you're in for a treat. Bonus: They also have a spicy burger for jalpeno lovers!</p>
        <li>
            <h4>
            <a href="https://www.southsideflyingpizza.com/">Southside Flying Pizza</a>  
            <b class="term">$</b>
        </h4>
    </li>
    <img src="https://duyt4h9nfnj50.cloudfront.net/resized/9365c6bb98e80eb7b8325032e363c39e-w2880-52.jpg" width=300>
        <p>With so much pizza to choose from here, I have to say Southside is consistently my go to. It's just something about their crust to sauce to cheese ratio that really knocks it out of the park! Pair the  <b class="term">Greensider</b> (a veggie packed 'za that I recommend adding some pepperoni to') with their <b class="term">greek salad</b>, and some <b class="term">cinnamon knots</b> and you're in for a good night. </p>
        <li>
            <h4>
            <a href="https://www.vazquezrestaurant.com/">Vasquez Restaurant</a> 
            <b class="term">$</b> 
        </h4>
        </li>
        <img src="https://www.fearlesscaptivations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vasquez-Restaurant-Tacos-Austin.jpg" width=300>
        <p>For some real authentic Mexican food hit up Vasquez! It's my household's favorite spot for breakfast, they've got classics like huevos ranceros, chilaquiles, and migas. I love the <b class="term">migas breakfast tacos</b> with cheese, plus their horchata is the best I've found in the city.</p>
        <li>
            <h4>
            <a href="https://www.padthaiaustinonline.com/">Pad Thai Cuisine</a>  
            <b class="term">$$</b>
        </h4>
    </li>

        <p>So this one is a bit of a splurge, but the portions are big enough to share or have half for leftovers! Try their <b class="term">spring rolls</b> with shrimp, their <b class="term">cheese rolls</b> (think Panda Express cheese rangoons but more cheese and les dry fried dough), and the <b class="term">Forever Taste pad thai</b>. ** NOT OFFERING DINE IN AT THIS TIME</p>
